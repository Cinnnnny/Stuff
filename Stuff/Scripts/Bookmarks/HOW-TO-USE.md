# Making Bookmarks
Inside the "Bookmarks" folder, there are some scripts that can be saved as bookmarks and dont need a console to open (more user friendly). Only do this if you are on a personal computer, because it wont save when you go to a new school computer.
### 1. Locate Bookmark script
Go to the script you want as a bookmark.
### 2. Save As as bookmark.
On your keyboard, hit Ctrl+Shift+O, then right click and click "add new bookmark". Then set the name of the script, and paste the code into the "URL" box.

### 3. Make sure Bookmarks are showing (optional)
If you want your bookmarks to be visible, hit Ctrl+Shift+B. If you dont want to use your keyboard, locate the three dots in the corner of the screen, bookmarks and lists, and show bookmarks bar.

Use the code by clicking the bookmark. This will run the script.
