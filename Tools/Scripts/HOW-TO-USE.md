## Making Bookmarks
Inside the "Bookmarks" folder, there are some scripts that can be saved as bookmarks and dont need a console to open (more user friendly). Only do this if you are on a personal computer, because it wont save when you go to a new school computer.

Go to the script you want as a bookmark.
### 2. Save As as bookmark.
On your keyboard, hit Ctrl+Shift+O, then right click and click "add new bookmark". Then set the name of the script, and paste the code into the "URL" box.
### 3. Use the code
Use the code by clicking the bookmark. This will run the script.
